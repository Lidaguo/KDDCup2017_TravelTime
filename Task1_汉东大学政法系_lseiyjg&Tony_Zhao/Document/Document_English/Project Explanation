Project Explanation

1.Read raw data



2.Select training data and validation data

validation data:
According to the time window before the target time window,data featured 6:00~8:00 and 15:00~17:00 from 10-25 to 10-31，we select the most similar 7 days as validation data.
To select the most similar 7 days, first we fill the NAN data with a naive xgboost model, and select the days with least sum of MAE(mean average error).The 7 days is generated as ../../Other/SelectValidation.csv.

training data：
data excluding the 7 validation days + data of validation days in time window 6:00~8:00,15:00~17:00



3.Delete abnormal data

As we test locally，we delete data which travel_time is bigger than 500 or smaller than 10.



4.Predict model
We use Xgboost mode，featured：
	one-hot feature of tollgate_id
	one-hot feature of intersection
	holiday
	weekday(0~6)
        one-hot feature of weekday(wk1~wk7)
        month
        time_number（a day is diveded in 72 parts by 20 minutes）
